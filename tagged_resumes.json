{"content": "Caleb McDougall Monk There are two key things on my resume that I feel would contribute to your company. Firstly my time travelling and volunteering. I recently spent six months travelling and volunteering from Colombia down to Brazil. In this time I had the opportunity to live and work with locals, picking up conversational Spanish and learning how to fit into different communities. I enjoyed having responsibilities such as self-management, organising travel plans, forming friendships with a variety of individuals, participating in charity programs (hearing aids & community clothing/food) and general community jobs. I loved the opportunity of living with locals and forming worldwide friendships and the common understandings that came along with the new experiences. I also appreciated the difficulties faced and time I spent out of my comfort zone, specifically how as I overcame challenges I felt more comfortable travelling autonomously, with flexibility and effective time management. Additionally, I have experience in Public Health work, the most influential work I have contributed to would be through my placement with the Townsville Public Health Unit (TPHU). This work greatly aided in my understanding of the functioning of a healthcare unit, particularly the simultaneously unique but interconnected roles of each section. I learned about the professional standards set to promote safe environments and the impact that projects and legislations have on this role. I developed knowledge on the current chronic and acute issues that affect health, nationally and locally. I picked up new skills such as entomology identification, statistical processes, insights into communicable diseases, the importance of community engagement and the tracking of notifiable conditions nationally. I attended field and lab sessions that improved my understanding of how to act and contribute to these skills. I learned about how changes to policy have changed the functioning of public health units and how important national policies and funding are to effective implementation programs. Crucially I got to experience the importance of ethical awareness in public health, with the need for confidentiality in individuals information, and the different requirements needed from health practitioners in Indigenous communities.

{"content": "Bella Mulcahy I describe myself as a people person and someone who enjoys interacting and learning from others. I have an inquiring mind and enjoy working in a team environment. I have experience in Counselling, administrative and teaching roles. I have always loved helping others no matter how big or small the contribution was. Areas such as talking to people via counselling and teaching swimming have been some of the ways I have achieved this. I also have many years of experience in administrative roles, whereby I gained extensive customer service skills, used my organisational ability and experienced working towards KPIxe2x80x99s. I am approachable and work well in meeting timelines. Similarly, with my studies, I have worked in groups on specific projects and given presentations, both of which have helped my development as well as understanding the most effective way to communicate within a group of likeminded peers. From my studies, I have gained a strong ability to critically think and analyse each situation though tools such as data analysis, communication and body language.
